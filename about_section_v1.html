          <h1>About Me.</h1>
          <h2>
           I'm Enam. A designer, front-end developer and problem solver.
          </h2>
        
          <p>I am passionate Front-End Developer with a degree in Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. While my academic journey began in the world of science.  The intersection of art and technology has always intrigued me, which led to creating a strong affinity  and drowning me to the exciting world of programming and web development. Over time, this growing interest evolved into a full-fledged career shift as I dove deep into the world of coding, design, and user experience.
<br> <br>
          Fast forward to 2020, I decided to shift my career toward this field. I started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript on my own. It was later I joined Amalitech where I completed an intensive 6-month bootcamp with 400+ hours of learning and mentoring. It was after Amalitech that I finally began designing end-to-end experiences.

          <br> <br>
          I‚Äôm committed to creating seamless, user-friendly experiences on the web. I‚Äôm always looking to expand my skills, and I‚Äôm currently learning UI/UX design, Flutter for mobile development, and ethical hacking to diversify my skillset and stay on top of the latest trends in technology.
  

           
           <br> <br>
           What excites me most about being a web developer is being able to design and create things that have purpose and solve real problems. It goes beyond designing buttons and websites and involves having a passion for designing experiences and solutions that help people, whether it's helping them make better videos, market themselves online, or buy something online. Leaning into customer insight and understanding their needs, finding the right problems to solve, delivering solutions as quickly as possible, learning from those and then iterating and improving that value over time is the key to great product design.
        
     
        <br> <br>
        <p>
          Beyond coding, I‚Äôm someone who loves to explore the world‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs through travel, experiencing new cultures, or simply riding my motorbike on an open road. I‚Äôm also an avid movie lover and music enthusiast, always looking for new sources of inspiration. As I continue to grow in my career, I‚Äôm focused on perfecting my coding skills while keeping up with emerging tech.
        </p>
    
     
        <br> <br>
        <p>
          Combining my scientific background with my passion for technology gives me a unique perspective on problem-solving, ensuring that I approach development with precision, creativity, and attention to detail. I‚Äôm excited about the future and look forward to continuing my journey as a developer, crafting meaningful digital experiences along the way.
        </p>

        This is one of my favourite quotes (by Peter Drucker):

         <h2>
           ‚ÄúThere is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.‚Äù
