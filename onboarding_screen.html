       I created an  Experimental Mobile App Sign-Up & Onboarding Screens. I aimed to create a seamless and visually engaging onboarding experience that would guide new users through the app with ease. The focus was on simplicity and user-centric designâ€”minimizing friction during the sign-up process and providing an interactive, clear introduction to the app's core features. This case study outlines my design process, key decisions, and the challenges I encountered while crafting a smooth and intuitive onboarding experience.

    <h2>
        Case Study: Experimental Mobile App Sign-Up & Onboarding Screens
    </h1>
    <h2>
        Project Overview
    </h2>
    <p>
        For this project, I designed a mobile app's sign-up and onboarding experience with a focus on simplicity, engagement, and user education. The goal was to create a seamless and engaging entry point for new users while maintaining a visually appealing, intuitive interface. This was an experimental approach, aiming to push boundaries in terms of user flow and interaction.
    </p>

<h2>Research & Insights</h2>
<p>After doing a quick round  research, that is talking to friends and family, we confirmed that most of our users would be viewing our responsive website on their mobile phones during their down time. For this reason, I opted for a mobile-first design to ensure that the experience was optimised for mobile users. I often like to start with a mobile design as I find that the space constraints force you to keep things focussed and simple.</p>

    <h2>
        Design Process
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Wireframing 
    </h3>
    <p>
        I started with basic wireframes to define the layout and flow of both the sign-up page and onboarding screens.
           </p>
           <div class="image_concept">
            <img src="Asset/SKETCH WIREFRAME.jpg"  width="90%" loading="lazy" alt="">
           </div>
    <p>
        The sign-up page was designed with a clear call-to-action (CTA) button and minimal fields. I avoided clutter by using single-sign-on options (Google/Facebook). 
    </p>

    <h3>
        Onboarding Screens
    </h3>    
    <div class="image_concept">
        <img  class="prototype_vid"  src="Asset/onboarding screen.png" width="100%" loading="lazy"  alt=""> <br>  <br>
    </div>
       
    <p> I created a series of onboarding screens that introduced users to the core features of the app, focusing on the appâ€™s value proposition.
        Each onboarding screen focused on one key feature with a short headline and a simple graphic.
        An interactive element was included in one of the screens, allowing users to swipe through an example of the appâ€™s key feature (e.g., a product discovery carousel).
        A clear "Join the community" button on the final onboarding screen, guiding users directly into the sign-up or sign-in page.</p>

 
    <p>
        The onboarding experience was kept short (3 screens) and interactive, with engaging animations and brief copy that explained the appâ€™s main features.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead of using text-heavy slides, I integrated visuals that told a story, showing how users could benefit from the app. This made the experience more digestible and enjoyable.
    </p>

    <h3>Sign-Up Page</h3>
    <div class="image_concept">
        <img class="prototype_vid"  src="Asset/sign up page.png" width="100%" alt=""> <br>  <br>
    </div>
    <p>
       
        A clean, distraction-free layout with a large CTA button.
Users can sign up via email, or through one-click Google or Facebook authentication.
The form is broken into three parts: full name, an email entry field, and password, a quick verification screen to make the process smoother.
    </p>



    <h3>
        Prototyping   
    </h3>
    <div class="image_concept">
        <img class="prototype_vid"src="Asset/onboardingscreen-ezgif.com-optimize.gif" loading="lazy" "></img>
    </div>
    
    <p>Using Figma I created high-fidelity prototypes that simulated the interactions between screens.</p>
    <p>Micro-interactions were incorporated to bring the design to life (e.g., button hover states, subtle transitions between onboarding screens, and progress indicators).</p>

    <h3>
        Usability Testing
    </h3>
    <p>I conducted several rounds of testing using tools like Maze and Lookback.io to observe how real users interacted with the design.</p>
    <p>Users had a positive response to the smooth transitions, interactive elements, and clear CTA buttons.</p>
    <p>Minor tweaks were made to reduce text on some onboarding screens, as users found the copy to be too long.</p>

    

    

        <h3>
            Learnings
        </h3>
        <p>
            Simplicity is Key: Keeping the sign-up form minimal and intuitive led to better conversion rates. 
        </p>
        <p>Engagement Through Interactivity: Interactive onboarding increases engagement and helps users retain information in a more enjoyable way.</p>
        <p>Continuous Testing: Iterative testing throughout the design process helped catch issues early and ensured the final design met user needs.</p>
